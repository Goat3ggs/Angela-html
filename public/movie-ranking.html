<h3>Talk To Me</h3>
<p>This was a really nice movie, scarry I can say and I like the song from a scene.</p>

<h3>The Creator</h3>
<p>I haven't seen sci-fi movies in a long time, but this one was the right thing at the right time.</p>

<h3>War Horse</h3>
<p>It is not the best movie nor the interesting one I've seen, but the atmosphere...</p>
